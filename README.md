# Wisconsin-Breast-Cancer
This project is all about predicting if a particular breast mass is
 - Benign (Benign Tumors tend to grow slowly and do not spread)
 - Malignant (Malignant tumors can grow rapidly, they invade and destroy nearby normal tissues, and spread throughout the body)
 
 This project makes use of the Breast cancer wisconsin dataset. It helps to predict what type of tumor it is using about 30 features of the tumor. In this project:
  - I visualized the dataset to see if there was a distinction between the features of the benign and malignant category
  - I used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensions and visualize the data in 2D
  - I encoded the categories into a binary column
  - I built about four Machine Learning algorithms and performed hyperparameter tuning using Gridsearch to find the best hyperparameters
  - I compared and visualized the evaluation of each model
